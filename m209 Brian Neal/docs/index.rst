Introduction
------------

The `M-209`_ is a mechanical cipher machine used by the US military during
World War II and up to the Korean War. The M-209 is also known as the CSP-1500
by the US Navy. The M-209 is an example of a Hagelin device, a family of
mechanical cipher machines created by Swedish inventor `Boris Hagelin`_, where
it is known as the C-38.

``m209`` is a complete `M-209`_ simulation library and command-line application
written in Python 3. ``m209`` is historically accurate, meaning that it can
exchange messages with an actual M-209 cipher machine.

It is hoped that this library will be useful to M-209 enthusiasts, historians,
and students interested in cryptography.

``m209`` strives to be Pythonic, easy to use, and comes with both unit tests
and documentation. ``m209`` is a library for building applications for
encrypting and decrypting M-209 messages. ``m209`` also ships with a simple
command-line application that can encrypt & decrypt messages for scripting and
experimentation.

Requirements
------------

``m209`` is written in Python_ 3, specifically Python 3.3. At this time it will
not run on Python 2.x.

``m209`` has no other requirements or dependencies.

Installation
------------

``m209`` is available on the `Python Package Index`_ (PyPI).

You can install it using pip_::

   $ pip install m209                  # install
   $ pip install --upgrade m209        # upgrade

You may also download an archive file of the latest code by visiting the `m209
Bitbucket page`_. Alternatively if you use Mercurial_, you can clone the
repository with the following command::

   $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/bgneal/m209

If you did not use pip (you downloaded or cloned the code yourself), you can
install with::

   $ cd where-you-extracted-m209
   $ python setup.py install

To run the unit tests::

   $ cd where-you-extracted-m209
   $ python -m unittest discover -b

Support & Source
----------------

All support takes place at the `m209 Bitbucket page`_. Please enter any
feature requests or bugs into the `issue tracker`_.

All of the resources listed below were useful to me in the creation of the
``m209`` library. In particular, I want to thank Mark J. Blair for his detailed
explanations of the M-209's operation and procedures. The official training
film was also highly instructive.
