The `M-209`_ is a mechanical cipher machine used by the US military during World
War II and up to the Korean War. The M-209 is also known as the CSP-1500 by
the US Navy. The M-209 is an example of a Hagelin device, a family of
mechanical cipher machines created by Swedish inventor `Boris Hagelin`_.

This project is a Python 3 library and command-line utility for encrypting and
decrypting text by simulating the operation of an actual M-209 device.

Please see the documentation_ for library usage, tutorials and
references.
